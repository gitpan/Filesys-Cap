NAME
    Filesys::Cap - Test filesystem capabilities/characteristics

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Filesys::Cap (from Perl
    distribution Filesys-Cap), released on 2014-06-26.

SYNOPSIS
     use Filesys::Cap qw(fs_has_attr_x fs_is_ci fs_is_cs);

     say "Filesystem has x attribute"     if fs_has_attr_x();
     say "Filesystem is case-insensitive" if fs_is_ci("/tmp");
     say "Filesystem is case-sensitive"   if fs_is_cs("/tmp");

FUNCTIONS
  fs_has_attr_x([ $dir ]) => bool
    Return true if filesystem has x attribute, meaning it can have files
    that pass "-x" Perl file test operator as well as files that fail it.
    This is done by creating two temporary files under $dir, one chmod-ed to
    0644 and one to 0755 and test the two files.

    If $dir is not specified, will use a temporary directory created by
    "tempdir()".

    Will return undef on failure.

  fs_is_ci([ $dir ]) => bool
    Return true if filesystem is case-insensitive, meaning it is impossible
    to create two files with the same name but differing case (e.g. "foo"
    and "Foo"). This is done by creating two temporary files under $dir.

    If $dir is not specified, will use a temporary directory created by
    "tempdir()".

    Will return undef on failure.

  fs_is_cs([ $dir ]) => bool
    The opposite of "fs_is_ci", will return true if filesystem is
    case-sensitive.

    To list filesystems and their properties (so, the more proper/rigorous
    version), see Sys::Filesystem.
